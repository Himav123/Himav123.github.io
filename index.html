    <h3>A Note on Temprature</h3>

          <h4>Green Tea</h4>
          <h5>140°F-185°F</h5>
          <p>Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process which is used to make oolong teas and black teas.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='light'>
          <h4>White Tea</h4>
          <h5>170°F-185°F</h5>
          <p> White tea is harvested before the tea plant’s leaves open fully, when the young buds are still covered by fine white hairs, hence the name “white” tea.</p>

    <li>
      <h2>China</h2>
      <p>China produces some 40% of the world’s tea weighing in at 2.4 million tonnes. It’s primarily grown in the provinces of Yunnan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang. While it’s the biggest exporter and grower of tea, China produces some of the best teas out there including Lapsang Souchong, Keemun and Green Gunpowder.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>India</h2>
      <p>900,000 tonnes are produced in India annually making it the world’s second largest producer of tea with the crop being grown in bulk across Darjeeling, Nilgiri and Assam.
The crop was first introduced commercially by the British in 1824 to compete with neighbouring China’s tea production monopoly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Kenya</h2>
      <p>Asia doesn’t have it all its own way, as we head across the Indian Ocean to the top tea producing country in Africa, Kenya, which harvests just under 305,000 tonnes of tea each year. Kenya claims the accolade of the world’s top black tea producing country, with teas grown in the Kericho region, the Nyambene Hills and Nandi.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Sri Lanka</h2>
      <p>Heading back to Asia and to Sri Lanka, which produces just under 300,000 tonnes, around 17% of the world’s tea crop grown in the central mountains. Sought teas like Dimbula, Kenilworth and Uva are cultivated here such as Ceylon.
The British in a bid to compete with China‘s tea production introduced the crop in 1867.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Turkey</h2>
      <p>This time we find ourselves in the Middle East, specifically to Turkey, which historically sat squarely on the ancient trades routes between east and west.Turkey grows 175,000 tonnes of tea.
Notably, they grow Riza, which is a tea from the region of the same name found on the Black Sea coast.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Indonesia</h2>
      <p>THeading offshore we head to Indonesia, which produces 157,000 tonnes of tea annually. The crop was introduced in the 1700’s by the Dutch East India Company during colonial rule, producing mostly black and green teas from Indian Assam varieties. The Indonesian climate allows these tea varieties to thrive.Indonesian teas are renowned the world over for their high levels of catechin, a natural phenol and antioxidant.
